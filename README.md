# Solving octal games

The goal here is to solve [octal games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal_game)
and [Grundy's game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundy%27s_game).

To solve these games is to find the period, if any, of the sequence of nim values
(as defined by [Sprague-Grundy theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem))
for all heap sizes.

Some results were published in the book
["Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_your_Mathematical_Plays).

More results were computed by [Achim Flammenkamp](http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/octal.html).

There are however still a lot of unsolved games, including Grundy's Game.

We are going to verify those results and solve some more games.
